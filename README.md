# Apartment App Backend 

## Rails API Initial Configuration
**just making the initial commit on main branch**  
1. Create empty github repo
  - create a team on github classroom  
  - refresh to get empty github repo (no cloning)  

2. Create Rails App `apartment_app_backend` 
and ask for branch protection 

3. Add the appropriate ruby gems for rspec testing configuration
  - If adding directly to Gemfile, then run $ `bundle` to add appropriate dependencies for the gems

4. Start server to ensure that the rails app was built correctly

5. Add the appropriate ruby gems for devise to create a User model
  - Update the schema
    - If received error message, $ `rails db:drop, rails db:create, rails db:migrate`

6. Add the appropriate ruby gems for jwt and cors
  - Disable authenticity token
  - Add cors.rb file to config/initializers

7. Generate resource to add model, controller, routes for Apartment
  ***NOTE: User will have many apartments; Apartment will belong to a user, which means it will need a foreign key***

8. Establish relationships for User and Apartment models

9. Update the schema

10. Create seeds
  - Create users
  ***NOTE: This code---> user1 = User.where(email: 'flow@waters.com').first_or_create(password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password') <---attempts to find a user with the email 'flow@waters.com'. If it finds a user with that email, it will return the existing user and won't change the password. If it doesn't find a user with that email, it will create a new user with the specified email, password, and password confirmation ('password').***  
  - Create apartments
  - Create a method that will save new instances to the database that are associated with each user and print out a confirmation that the instance was created

11. Populate database with mock data from seed file

12. Follow the file path as designated in the syllabus to modify the config directory

13. Generate devise users sessions and registrations controllers to manage the tokens

14. Modify the devise routes

15. Create a JWT token
 ***NOTE: alternative way to save jwt key ---> Store the token in a variable, Close the application (VS Code), Should see confirmation ---> File encrypted and saved.***  
to the Gemfile to allow our devise and jwt setup: rack-cors, devise, devise-jwt, dotenv-rails

16. Generate jwt_denylist model to store the revoked JWT tokens
***NOTE: Be mindful of the singular snake_case naming conventions for the model and change method.***

17. Update schema

18. Modify the User model to reflect this revocation strategy

19. Exclude `.DS_Store` from version control
  ***NOTE: .DS_Store is a file that is automatically generated by the mac operating system. The name stands for "Desktop Services Store." They can become visible when interacting with the GUI on Finder and CLI on Git. To exclude .DS_Store files from being included in a Git repository, you can add the following line to your .gitignore file: .DS_Store*** 

20. Connect the two repos with the git remote code from the empty github repo

21. Perform initial commit

22. Ask for branch protection on main branch
